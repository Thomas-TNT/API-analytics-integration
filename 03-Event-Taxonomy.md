# Event Taxonomy & Tracking Requirements - API Analytics Integration

## **Event Taxonomy & Tracking Requirements**

### **Category 1: Clinical Workflow Events (From Audit Logs)**
```javascript
// Already captured in audit system
- Case Creation (SP_INSERT_CASE)
- Patient Management (SP_INSERT_Patient, SP_UPDATE_Patient)
- Treatment Planning (SP_INSERT_TreatmentOption, SP_INSERT_TreatmentStep)
- Resource Management (SP_INSERT_CaseResource, SP_ActivateCaseResource)
- User Management (SP_INSERT_User, SP_UPDATE_User)
```

### **Category 2: Enhanced Clinical Analytics**
```javascript
// New events to add
- Treatment Plan Completion (completion_time, success_rate, user_satisfaction)
- Resource Effectiveness (resource_usage, patient_outcomes, engagement_metrics)
- Workflow Efficiency (time_to_completion, error_rates, user_friction_points)
- Clinical Decision Support (recommendation_acceptance, alternative_selections)
```

### **Category 3: User Experience Analytics**
```javascript
// User behavior insights
- Feature Adoption (new_feature_usage, adoption_rate, user_feedback)
- Navigation Patterns (page_views, session_duration, bounce_rates)
- Error Tracking (error_frequency, resolution_time, user_impact)
- Performance Metrics (load_times, response_times, system_health)
```

### **Category 4: Business Intelligence**
```javascript
// Organizational insights
- Organization Utilization (subscription_usage, feature_adoption, growth_metrics)
- User Onboarding (signup_to_first_case, training_completion, success_rates)
- Compliance Metrics (audit_trail_completeness, data_access_patterns, security_events)
- Revenue Analytics (subscription_value, feature_usage_correlation, expansion_opportunities)
```
