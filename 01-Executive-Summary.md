## **Executive Summary**

This PRD outlines the integration of MyCare's existing API audit trail system with Freshpaint analytics to create a comprehensive, HIPAA-compliant analytics foundation. Unlike typical implementations that start from scratch, MyCare already has a rich audit logging system that can be leveraged for immediate analytics insights.

**Key Advantages:**
- **Existing Audit Trail**: 247 stored procedures with built-in audit logging
- **Rich Medical Context**: Deep clinical workflow data already captured
- **Compliance-Ready**: Audit logs already meet healthcare compliance requirements
- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Organization-level analytics with role-based insights

## **Problem Statement**

### **Current State**
- **Rich Data Foundation**: MyCare API has comprehensive audit logging but no analytics integration
- **Manual Reporting**: Clinical insights require manual database queries and analysis
- **Limited Visibility**: No real-time insights into user behavior, workflow efficiency, or system performance
- **Compliance Gap**: Audit data exists but isn't accessible for business intelligence

### **Business Impact**
- **Clinical Insights**: Unable to measure treatment plan effectiveness or workflow optimization
- **User Experience**: No visibility into user friction points or feature adoption
- **Operational Efficiency**: No metrics for system performance or error patterns
- **Business Intelligence**: Rich audit data is underutilized for strategic decisions
