- Implementation strategy with code examples
- Phase-by-phase approach

### **03-Event-Taxonomy.md**

- Dependencies and assumptions

### **06-Acceptance-Criteria.md**
- Phase-by-phase acceptance criteria
- Document approval process
- Key advantages summary

### **07-Complete-Event-List.md**
- **Complete breakdown of all 247 trackable events**
- Organized by category (Case Management, Patient Management, etc.)
- User role mapping and clinical module mapping
- Event mapping examples

## **Key Highlights**

### **Immediate Value**
- **247 stored procedures** already generating audit events
- **Rich medical context** with clinical workflow data
- **HIPAA-compliant** audit framework already in place
- **Multi-tenant architecture** with organization-level analytics

### **Strategic Advantage**
Unlike typical analytics implementations that start from scratch, MyCare has a comprehensive audit logging system that can be leveraged for immediate analytics insights. This provides:

1. **Instant Analytics**: 247 events ready to track from day one
2. **Clinical Depth**: Comprehensive coverage from diagnosis to outcomes
3. **Compliance Built-in**: All events already meet healthcare audit requirements
4. **Cost-Effective**: Maximize existing infrastructure investment

### **Implementation Approach**
- **Phase 1**: Leverage existing audit logs (Weeks 1-2)
- **Phase 2**: Add custom event tracking (Weeks 3-4)
- **Phase 3**: Advanced analytics in GA4 (Weeks 5-6)
- **Phase 4**: Optimization and training (Weeks 7-8)

## **Quick Reference**

### **Most Important Events to Track First**
1. **Case Creation** (`SP_INSERT_CASE` → `case_created`)
2. **Treatment Plan Selection** (`SP_INSERT_TreatmentOption` → `treatment_option_created`)
3. **Resource Activation** (`SP_ActivateCaseResource` → `case_resource_activated`)
4. **User Activity** (All `SP_GET_*` procedures → `*_viewed` events)

### **Key User Roles**
- **Physician** (Role 6): Primary clinical decision makers
- **Nurse** (Role 4): Clinical workflow participants
- **Administrator** (Role 5): System management
- **Patient** (Role 8): End users of educational resources

### **Clinical Modules**
- **Liver Cancer Module**: Primary focus area
- **Lung Cancer Module**: Secondary focus
- **Brain, Prostate, Breast**: Additional modules

## **Next Steps**

1. **Review** the complete event list in `07-Complete-Event-List.md`
2. **Prioritize** which events to implement first based on business goals
3. **Plan** the implementation timeline using `04-Implementation-Roadmap.md`
4. **Validate** technical requirements with the development team
5. **Execute** Phase 1 implementation leveraging existing audit logs
